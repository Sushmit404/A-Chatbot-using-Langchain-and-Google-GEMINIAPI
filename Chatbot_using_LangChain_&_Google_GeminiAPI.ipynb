            "['This gift of an Amphora, a vase with a specific characteristic shape, is from Cyprus. This ceramic vase is of white painted ware from the Geometric period ca. 700–600 B.C. \\u202fThe vessel has two handles and a narrow neck. The design is commonly \"\"big bellied\"\" and narrowed at the base. The ancient Mediterranean world commonly used the amphora for transporting and storing many commodities such as olive oil, grapes, wine, olives, grain, fish and many others perishable liquid and dry food stuffs. Many shape variations were used for ancient vase painting and illustrations. Ancient Cyprus was acknowledged for both its wine and olive oil production. Olive oil was important for food, fuel for household lamps, basic ingredients for bath oils, soaps, perfumes, cosmetics and medicinal ointments. Cypriot oil was imported into Egypt, Syria and other large coastal cities and networks.

She was a violent and powerful goddess who struck terror into gods and humans alike. She had a significant influence on many later goddesses, including the famous Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite. The Assyrians worshipped Ishtar as a war goddess and made her the consort of their national god Assur. The ancient Greeks named her Astarte and the Bible mentions her as Ashtoreth. Ishtar was the goddess of the ancient empires who prospered around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers which are in today’s Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, and Turkiye.This is a faithful plaster reproduction of the 1,800-year-old sculptural relief. The original (first or second century C.E.) bas-relief was discovered in Palmyra and is now on display at the National Museum in Damascus. That region, Mesopotamia, is home to the great ancient empires and acknowledged as the cradle of civilization. Ishtar’s symbolic role for war, leading to the dispensing of justice, and her love, to protect those communities she cared for, make her an enduring cultural symbol.The gift was presented by the Permanent Representative of Syria to the United Nations, Mowaffak Allaf, to the United Nations, and was accepted by Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim.The Secretary-General said the work recalled the continuity of civilization in the Middle East and the pressing responsibilities to find lasting peace so its people can go into a more prosperous and happier future.Mr. Allaf said the gift symbolizes hope for \" a future in which abundance shall replace poverty and economic development shall be the substitute for the arms race.”', 'The “Edict of Cyrus” is an ancient declaration of human rights and this replica was made by the British Museum from the original in their collection.

It has an incised abstract emblem that indicates the typical graphic expression of the Meroitic Period of Sudanese art. These non-pictorial elements were common of the Meroitic Period (270 BC – 400 CE).Meroё, an ancient city during the Meroitic Period, was on the east bank of the Nile, near Shendi, Sudan and was the city capital for the Kingdom of Kush. There was much development in this region and rivals a similar development in Ancient Egypt, and was part of the Egyptian Kingdom at times. The city even has more than 200 pyramids classified as Nubian pyramids. Their development became independent as part of the Meroitic Period and accordingly the Egyptian hieroglyphics that had been previously used in the area were change to Meroitic script as well as deities replaced, from Egyptian to local gods such as Apeddemak, the lion god.

This ceramic vase is of white painted ware from the Geometric period ca. 700–600 B.C. \\u202fThe vessel has two handles and a narrow neck. The design is commonly \"\"big bellied\"\" and narrowed at the base. The ancient Mediterranean world commonly used the amphora for transporting and storing many commodities such as olive oil, grapes, wine, olives, grain, fish and many others perishable liquid and dry food stuffs. Many shape variations were used for ancient vase painting and illustrations. Ancient Cyprus was acknowledged for both its wine and olive oil production. Olive oil was important for food, fuel for household lamps, basic ingredients for bath oils, soaps, perfumes, cosmetics and medicinal ointments. Cypriot oil was imported into Egypt, Syria and other large coastal cities and networks. Today, archaeologists use these ancient vases to identify shipwrecks, the site age, and the volumes of shipments traveling overseas and elsewhere.Cyprus donated the vase to the United Nations on 23 May 1970.', 'This sculptural replica of Ishtar, the great goddess of love and war, was one of the most important Mesopotamian deities. She was a violent and powerful goddess who struck terror into gods and humans alike. She had a significant influence on many later goddesses, including the famous Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite. The Assyrians worshipped Ishtar as a war goddess and made her the consort of their national god Assur. The ancient Greeks named her Astarte and the Bible mentions her as Ashtoreth. Ishtar was the goddess of the ancient empires who prospered around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers which are in today’s Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, and Turkiye.This is a faithful plaster reproduction of the 1,800-year-old sculptural relief. The original (first or second century C.E.) bas-relief was discovered in Palmyra and is now on display at the National Museum in Damascus. That region, Mesopotamia, is home to the great ancient empires and acknowledged as the cradle of civilization. Ishtar’s symbolic role for war, leading to the dispensing of justice, and her love, to protect those communities she cared for, make her an enduring cultural symbol.The gift was presented by the Permanent Representative of Syria to the United Nations, Mowaffak Allaf, to the United Nations, and was accepted by Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim.The Secretary-General said the work recalled the continuity of civilization in the Middle East and the pressing responsibilities to find lasting peace so its people can go into a more prosperous and happier future.Mr. Allaf said the gift symbolizes hope for \" a future in which abundance shall replace poverty and economic development shall be the substitute for the arms race.”', 'The “Edict of Cyrus” is an ancient declaration of human rights and this replica was made by the British Museum from the original in their collection. The original cylinder was found in March 1879, during excavations in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) for the British Museum. It is an ancient clay cylinder and dated 539 BC. The case in which it is displayed was designed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and contains English and French translations of the ancient Persian text as well as the replica itself.In September 2010, the National Museum of Iran opened the Cyrus Cylinder exhibition and the British Museum loaned their Cyrus Cylinder for the exhibit. The cylinder texts indicate that everyone is entitled to freedom and choice and that all individuals should respect one another. The cylinder also suggests resisting oppression, defending the oppressed, respecting human dignity and recognizes human rights. The exhibition promoted the idea that the Iranian nation has always supported justice, devotion, and human values since the earliest times.On 14 October 1971, the Iranian Shah’s sister, Princess Ashraf Pahiava, presented to the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant a replica of the cylinder on behalf of the country of Iran. She said, “the heritage of the Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding, tolerance, courage, compassion and above all, human liberty”.The Secretary-General linked the gift with the efforts of the United Nations General Assembly with “the questions of Respect for Human Rights in Armed conflict.', 'This gift of a replica scalloped crown is a unique historical find at the early formation of the Tajik people and its more than 2,500-year-old culture, dating back to 500 B.C. The National Museum of Tajikistan holds the original and it demonstrates the rich history and legacy of Tajik people. Related to the Tajik ethnic name, the word \"Tojik\" is from the word \"Toj\" and means \"crowned\". Tajikistan, in Central Asia, shares its borders with China, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan and their largest ethnic group is the Tajiks. Most of its citizens speak the Tajik language, and international communications are in Russian. As a modern secular state with a government constitution allowing religious freedom, there is a Muslim population of both Sunni and Shia observers, and they are proud of this ancient Tajik culture and its traditions. The ancient “Silk Road” crosses their land of valleys and mountains and became a convergence of Mediterranean, Indian and Chinese civilizations, exchanging technologies, teachings, and resources.This gift from Tajikistan was given by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, H. E. Mr. Emomali Rahmon, and was accepted by United Nations representative Ms. Catherine Pollard, Under-Secretary-General for Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and is the Chairperson for the Arts Committee.It represents the Tajik people who have peacefully coexisted and collaborated with other civilizations, peoples, and Nations since ancient times. Recognizing cultural heights and identity preservation, a Nation and its people can connect to humankind’s collective civilization.', 'This gift is a black pot decorated with carved lines and dots. It has an incised abstract emblem that indicates the typical graphic expression of the Meroitic Period of Sudanese art. These non-pictorial elements were common of the Meroitic Period (270 BC – 400 CE).Meroё, an ancient city during the Meroitic Period, was on the east bank of the Nile, near Shendi, Sudan and was the city capital for the Kingdom of Kush. There was much development in this region and rivals a similar development in Ancient Egypt, and was part of the Egyptian Kingdom at times. The city even has more than 200 pyramids classified as Nubian pyramids. Their development became independent as part of the Meroitic Period and accordingly the Egyptian hieroglyphics that had been previously used in the area were change to Meroitic script as well as deities replaced, from Egyptian to local gods such as Apeddemak, the lion god. Today, Meroe is the largest archeological site in the Sudan. In June 2011, the archeological sites of Meroë were listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.The gift is from the Government of the Republic of the Sudan to the United Nations.', 'In 1969, archaeologists discovered the remains of a youth of about 16-18 years old in a funeral suit decorated in gold at an ancient burial grave dated to approximately 1000 BCE. This set of gold-embroidered armour, hat, and boots were recreated by scientists and professional replicators along with other precious artefacts found at the site of the Issyk burial mound in southern Kazakhstan. The costume together was quickly named The Golden Man.The costume includes a high cap decorated with winged horses, snow leopards, trees, birds, and wild rams. It is decorated with many gold plates and gold jewellery that were made by pressing or stamping the bas relief symbols. All gold pieces were sewn onto the rough leather and because the original was in such good preservation, the replicator team was able to reconstruct this attire theorized to be that of a young person, possibly a prince or priest. This 1st millennium BCE archaeological find of the Golden Man shows the developed culture of the Kazakh people and is a symbol of Kazakhstan’s national heritage. Another replica is also on display at the State Museum of Gold and Precious Metals of the Republic of Kazakhstan in Astana.The gift was presented to the United Nations by President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan A. Nazarbaev and was accepted by Secretary-General Kofi Annan. It has travelled internationally to exhibitions in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.', \"This Replica of the Obelisk of Aksum, or Axum, is a hand-carved ivory model of a 70 foot tall ancient stele found in Aksum, in modern-day Ethiopia. Aksum was the seat of Ethiopia’s Government for the first nine centuries C.E.. The original was constructed around 327 C.E. and is made from granite. It was carved to represent a 9-story building with two false doors at the base and decorations resembling windows on all sides. The obelisk is crowned by a semi-circular top, thought to represent the sun.This replica measures 65 inches in height, tapering from 8 inches wide at the base to 5 inches at the top. The ivory model rests on a wooden base which bears an inscription in both English and Arabic that says, “Presented by His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I Emperor of Ethiopia to the United Nations Organization Consecrated to the Service of the Brotherhood of Man Dedicated to the Preservation of World Peace Devoted to the Defense of Man's Basic Human Rights.”The gift was presented to the United Nations by His Imperial Majesty, Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia (1892 – 1975), during his official visit to the United Nations Headquarters on October 4th, 1963 and was accepted on behalf of the United Nations by Secretary-General U Thant.In 1937, the original Obelisk was removed from Ethiopia and brought offsite. In 1980, UNESCO recognized the obelisk as an important cultural monument and put it on the World Heritage List. In 2005, it was agreed that the iconic sculpture that had stood in place for more than 1,700 years would be brought back into place. In 2008, UNESCO completed the project and can be seen by both citizens and tourist alike.\", \"This gift of a stone Palenque Head sculpture is a replica of the one discovered during excavations of the city of Palenque and is believed to depict Mayan King Pakal. The original artifact is in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, Mexico.The great Mayan King K'inich Janaab Pakal I or Lord Pacal (603 – 683 CE) ascended to the throne as a child and ruled for 68 years over the city of Palenque, in what is today southern Mexico. King Pakal initiated a well-documented, ambitious expansion of the city. His most famous architectural project is the Temple of the Inscriptions, where he was laid to rest, whose extraordinary hieroglyphics have been significant to the study of the ancient Mayan culture.After Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld visited Mexico in 1959 and admired the Palenque Head, a stone replica was made specially for and gifted to SG Hammarskjöld by the National Museum of Anthropology and the Mexican United Nations Committee. It was on display in Hammarskjöld’s suite at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City until the formation of his museum, Dag Hammarskjölds Backåkra in Löderup, Sweden.Later, an additional Palenque was provided to the United Nations for display within the Headquarters’ campus.\", 'The Ngoc Lu Bronze Drum is an important artifact of the Dong Son culture of the Bronze Age, a civilization that flourished in first millennium B.C. in the Red River Delta of Vietnam. Around 1893 – 1894, workers accidently discovered the drum while working on the construction of the levee of the Red River near the village. They named the drum Ngoc Lu after the name of their village. Historians and archaeologists highly value the drum because of its well-preserved and richly decorated nature.This artifact demonstrates advanced bronze metallurgy skills of the ancient Vietnamese people. It symbolizes the peak of skills and arts of the Hung dynasty in Vietnam. The tympanum has three panels with animals or humans separated by bands of geometric and circular patterns.

Surya is widely worshipped in India and is an unbroken, ancient tradition that is more than 5,000 years old.In the sculpture, Surya stands in a frontal position holding two fully bloomed lotuses in his hands. According to myth, when Surya rises, the lotus blooms. The lotus flower is important in Surya iconography because it blooms after receiving the sun rays in the morning. Surya’s hands are shown in the famous Surya mudra (hand gesture), which is used in yoga for better metabolism and rendering energy. Surya is accompanied by his two consults, Suremnyu, the goddess of dawn, and Chaiya, the goddess of shadow. The two goddesses on either side are Usha, the rising sun, and Retusha, the setting sun, who are shooting arrows to dispel darkness. Flanking Surya are his two attendants Danda and Pingale. One of them has an inkpot and pen and the other has a rod. Immediately on both sides of Surya are his consorts Chaya and Suvarchala who are waving ceremonial whisks, Chauri, which symbolize authority.

This site is about 12,000 years old, dated to approximately 9500-8000 BCE, and is currently considered the world’s oldest purpose-built religious site, predating Stonehenge by about 6,000 years.This limestone pillar stands at 2.6m (8’-6”) tall from the base and weighs approximately 1,400 kgs, including the base. The pillar is decorated with relief patterns seen across the Göbeklitepe archaeological site. There is a motif of a hand and arm down the narrow front side, a pattern of ‘H’ type shapes and a foxlike creature adorns the wider side.In 1963, Universities of Istanbul and Chicago discovered this ancient site. In 1995, the German Archaeological Institute and Şanlıurfa Museum found the stone sculptures. In 2018, it was accepted on UNESCO’s World Heritage list. In 2021, a replica of the stele was placed in the United Nations North Lawn garden with New York City’s skyscrapers as a backdrop highlighting the comparison of engineering across 12,000 years. The site importance is that researchers believed 10,000 years ago was the primitive life of hunter-gathers. Instead, this discovery broke previous beliefs and now new concepts of humanity emerges for this time period. There would need to be consideration for the mounting of these massive stones, intricate carvings, and a reverence for the symbols depicted.The Stele was given by Turkiye to the United Nations in September 2021. After addressing the 76th UN General Assembly on the 21st of September 2021, President Erdoğan visited the replica of the obelisk on display in the UN garden.In 2018, Göbeklitepe was accepted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as one of the first examples of human-made monumental architecture and the transition of humanity from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to cooperative farm-centric living.', 'This classical bronze statue is a replica of a classical sculpture of Poseidon (circa 460 B.C.E.). The original sculpture (Hellenistic period) was discovered in 1926 and unearthed in 1928 from the bottom of the sea off the coast of the Cape of Artemision, Greece. The original resides in the National Archeological Museum, in Athens, Greece.There has long been dispute about whether the sculpture depicts the god Poseidon or his brother Zeus. The right hand would have held a thunderbolt if Zeus or a trident if Poseidon. This god is in motion and you can see that from the stance he takes, one arm and leg outstretched towards an enemy and the other bent as if in movement to strike.This elegant and balanced figure is the embodiment of beauty, control, and strength. The figure is shown in full heroic nudity and is attributed to the work of a great sculptor, possibly Kalamis, of the 5th century B.C.At the time of the donation the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations, Alexis Kyrou, said, “Greece is today unreservedly and devotedly attached to the principle of cooperation embodied in the United Nations.”Upon the sculpture’s acceptance, Secretary-General Tryve Lie said, “The United Nations is indeed grateful to your government for the gift of this replica of one of the finest examples of the sculpture of ancient Greece.

It is believed to have been made about 238 CE. or early that century. About 150 years earlier, Pompeii’s Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE. where there are many similar mosaics, yet perhaps not as well preserved. This wall-mounted mosaic depicts the cycle of the year and conveys happiness, prosperity, and optimism. The composition is an example of the Roman practice of personifying nature. At the center is a nude adolescent who represents the spirit of the year and the four corner figures correspond to the four seasons: Spring with roses, Summer with wheat, Autumn with a vineyard, Winter with olives. The plants help delineate the ovals and the birds, such as peacocks, pheasants, herons, ducks, and geese, frame the perimeter medallions. The design is characteristic of the romantic ‘Romana Africa’ style, which came to its peak as early as the 3rd century.The gift was presented by the President of Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba (1903 – 2000), to the United Nations and Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold (1905 – 1961) accepted it on 12 May 1961.', 'During the 13th and 14th centuries, travelers and messengers used geregee or paiza as a passport or document on the Mongol yam or postal route. Depending on the material and shape of the geregee, travelers had different privileges. The better the material meant the more rights they had. Geregee were made of wood, bronze, silver, or gold.Chinggis Khan, the Great Khan (also known as Genghis Khan), distributed the geregee to officials and envoys so they could move freely, easily access food and horses, and receive respect¬¬ and courtesy. Under the protection of the Great Khan and the Mongolian Empire, envoys went on diplomatic missions and to different countries around the world efficiently. States and individuals provided aid and protection when needed.The gift is historically significant because the geregee is one of the first universally recognized document entitling diplomatic immunity and privileges. It contributed to the development of norms and laws of diplomatic relations.The government of Mongolia presented the geregee or golden paiza to the United Nations.', \"The Blue Lotus Plaque is an 8th century CE original terracotta.

This plaque has the carved representation of the Blue or Night Lotus. The lotus is regarded as a divine flower and appears in almost all religious edifices. Its highly stylized and ornamental elements indicate sophisticated workmanship and masterly touches. It is thought that this may be the work of a commissioned royal artist.Blue Lotus was presented by Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina to the United Nations on the 25th Anniversary of its Admission to the United Nations on 17th September 1999.Secretary-General Kofi Annan said at the ceremony, “The monastery, whose wall this graceful lotus once adorned, was an important centre of learning when Europe was still in its “Dark Ages.” He said further, “the United Nations is grateful for the contribution Bangladesh has made to so many aspects of its work, from peacekeeping to service on the Economic and Social Council and a leading role in the group of least developed countries.”\", \"This entrance stone at the top of a doorway, or lintel, is from a Synagogue in Kafr Yasif, in Western Galilee, Israel.

Within the circle at right is a lulav (palm branch) and outside the circle at right is a shofar (ram's horn). The menorah is one of the oldest symbols for the Jewish people and is treasured as a symbol of faith and culture. The composition is not symmetrical which is characteristic of the Jewish artisans from the Glan Heights and of this period.This artifact holds deep artistic, historical and cultural significance for Israel and the Jewish people. The Israeli Government is proud to present it as a token of Israel's participation in the United Nations.This gift, given on the occasion of Israel’s 50th Anniversary of admission to the United Nations, was presented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, H.E.

The original sculpture was made in the Early Bronze Age and dates back to 1400 B.C.E. The sculpture depicts a horse drawing a large disc, which is gilded on one side, illustrating the idea that the sun was drawn on its eternal journey by a divine horse. The elegant spiral decoration that graces the golden sun disc reveals its Nordic origin. The journey of the sun across the sky was an important element in Bronze Age religion and the motif appears elsewhere in Scandinavia, particularly in rock art and on small bronze objects from the same time period.The Sun Chariot was probably sacrificed to the sun and placed in the bog where it remained until its discovery in 1902. The original sculpture is on display in the National Museum in Copenhagen, Denmark. This replica was made by silversmith Georg Jensen in Copenhagen.Queen Margarethe II of Denmark presented the gift to the United Nations on February 22, 1991 on behalf of the Danish people.

The original stele, which dates back almost 3,800 years, stands in the Louvre in Paris and was found in 1901. The stele is the oldest written code of laws known to mankind. The stele depicts Hammurabi facing the God of the Sun and receiving the laws from him. The code is the longest surviving text from the Old Babylonian period and is seen as an early example of fundamental law and government regulation. Some topics mentioned in the codes are issues relating to slander, trade, adultery and more.The Government of Iraq presented this gift to the United Nations on 23 September 1977. The presenter, Sa’adoun Hammadi, Foreign Minister of Iraq, emphasized the importance of the replica to the people of Iraq and the people of the world as the first national code of laws recorded in history.Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim said, “This thoughtful gift of Iraq reminds us that building an equitable and just international community is not a job for any one time in man’s history but is an endless and timeless task that demands continuous patience, dedication and determination”.', 'The God Osiris is a gilded bronze statuette produced in c. 700 B.C.E. Osiris was recognised as the god of fertility, agriculture, resurrection int this period. With the hope of new life after death, Osiris began to be associated with nature cycles, including the flooding of the Nile and the start of a new harvest. Osiris is often depicted as a covered mummy to emphasize his transformed state. In his hands he is holding a flail and a short shepherd’s crook to indicate Egyptian kingship. The statue has a long, braided beard, and is wearing an Atef crown with an uraeus on the front, which is a sacred cobra ready to attack enemies. The horns are associated with the sun god, who becomes a ram-headed man at dusk and throughout the night. Statues and statuettes of Osiris were popular by the first millennium B.C.E.The Permanent Representative of Egypt to the United Nations, A. Esmat Abdel Meguid, said that Osiris was supposed to have been a prophet who “pacified and civilized the world … saving it from barbarism, by persuasion and music as opposed to violent and forceful means” and creating “a civilized world where justice prevails.”When receiving the gift, Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim said the statuette “is a striking example of the glories of Egyptian culture and civilization.

The man is posed confidently, displaying a bare, muscular chest, with his free hand placed on his hip. His earlobes are stretched past his shoulders, a common motif in Buddhism representative of an individual’s rejection of the material world in favor of spiritual enlightenment. This stone sculpture has been executed using a deep relief carving method.The artwork is an example of 10th century Khmer sculpture (French spelling Khmère). Khmer sculptures are from the Hindu and Buddhist Khmer Empire or Angkorian Empire, which reigned from the 9th - 15th century in modern-day Cambodia. The most celebrated examples of Khmer sculpture were created in the 10th century and can be found in Angkor, Cambodia. The style was inspired from Indian and Hindu influences. Through artistic evolution, it developed its own style, which reached its apex by the 10th century. By developing beyond the confines of religious scenes, this style later portrayed court figures as gods and goddesses.The gift was given by President of Democratic Kampuchea, Norodom Sihanouk (1922 – 2012), and he held this office from 17 April 1975 – 2 April 1976.

They are credited as main donors and patrons of the Boyana Church.In the painting, Sebastocrator Kaloyan is dressed in a dark blue tunic and a green robe and his hands hold a model of the church. Desislava is attired in a green and golden tunic and her rosy-white face peeks out from under a small hat. Their portraits by the painters of Tarnovo Artistic School in Boyana Church are considered by many as some of the first Renaissance images in European art.Desislava was reasonably famous at this time and she became a muse of many writers, poets, and artists later. She was considered the epitome of Bulgarian women and was portrayed in literature and art as beautiful, free, and independent.The Government of Bulgaria represented by Peter Mladenov, Minister for Foreign Affairs, presented the gift to the United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Walheim in a ceremony. Minister Mladenov said the portrait was “an expression of Bulgaria’s allegiance” to the United Nations. The Permanent Representative of the People’s Republic of Bulgaria to the United Nations, Guero Grozev, was also at the ceremony. The Secretary-General said this “magnificent gift” was a reminder of the “generosity and imagination of the Government of Bulgaria, and of the commitment of the peoples of Bulgaria to the objectives of the world organization”.', 'This Kadesh Peace Treaty is a copper replica of the original which is the oldest known peace treaty. The original clay tablet treaty, dated 1269 BC, was signed by Hattusilli III, King of the Hittites, and Ramses, Pharaoh of the Egyptians. The treaty marked the end of a long war between the Hittite Empire and the Egyptians, who had fought for over two centuries to gain mastery over the lands of the eastern Mediterranean. Found in 1906, in central Anatolia, Turkiye, on the site of the old Hittite capital, Hattusa, it records the text in cuneiform script. The original is kept at the Archaeological Museum in Istanbul. The replica was made by Sadi Calik, a sculptor and lecturer at the Istanbul College of Fine Arts.The treaty pledges eternal friendship, lasting peace, territorial integrity, nonaggression, extradition, and mutual help. The pledges in this treaty are similar to the United Nations ideals. The replica was presented to the United Nations by Ihsan Sabri Caglayangil, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkiye on behalf of the country of Turkiye and accepted by Secretary-General U Thant. It is placed in the second-floor delegates corridor of the Conference building, near the entrance of the Security Council Chamber.', 'This ceremonial mantle from Peru is a rare textile found in the burial grounds of Paracas in southern Peru. Because of the dryness of the climate, it was found in a remarkable state of preservation in the 1930’s and is thought to be 2,000 to 3,000 years old.Paracas mantles were part of the formal attire worn by chiefs, priests, and other prominent members of the Paracas society. Textiles were valued by the Paracas and were worn to indicate status and authority. Even in death people were wrapped in several layers of textile, a single person could be buried in as many as 30 mantles.Paracas mantles were made from animal camelid wool, probably from llamas or alpacas, and plant fibers. They were made in bright colors such as indigo, green, pink, and white, which were all procured using natural dyes.The mantle has been sealed in a vacuum for preservation.The ceremonial mantle was gifted to the United Nations from Government of Peru on 12 May 1957.', \"This replica is a classic example of a sculpture of the Gouro (or Guro) region, in the Central West part of Côte d'Ivoire. The sculpture portrays a Gouro woman and symbolizes the feminine aspect responsible for the biological continuity of the Gouro people, for family in particular and society in general. The original sculpture is part of the Museum of Civilizations of Cote d’Ivoire’s collection, a state Museum in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. The museum collection has over 15,000 artworks and are authentic to the region. The collection has statues, musical instruments, masks, archaeological finds, textiles, and colourful paintings. Conflict in the region in 2011, however, may have caused the loss of many items.The gift was given to United Nations on October 31, 2003. This is the first gift from Côte d'Ivoire to the UN.\"], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}\n"
